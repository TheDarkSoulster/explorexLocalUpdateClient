**Update Changelog:**

- **AI Search Summary:** When you search anything, you’ll now be able to see an AI Search Summary Alongside results.
- **Improved User Interface:** We’ve categorized the ExploreX tools, along with some other minor improvements.
- **Added Search Parameters:** You can now search the web across just one website. Such as a Google, but this one only looks across a selected website of choice.
- **AI SafeSearch Integration:** ExploreX AI has been given upgraded capabilities, now such that it will analyze and determine whether a specific search is relevant or not. It also helps to protect students against the dangers of the internet by blocking the search, even ones that can be bypassed by using a VPN, or a hotspot network.
- **Google Lens Integration:** Not sure what something is? Now look it up using the Google Lens Integration. Simply upload the image, you you’ll get your results in no time.
- **Remote Mindmap Syncing:** The Mindmap now saves if you use it absolutely anywhere inside the app, even in different screens.
- **Remote Google Translate:** You can now access Translation Features from the Browser Screen.
